"Everybody wanted to know what we would do if it didn't fly, I guess we'll never know" **mic drop**

This document outlines the software files in our repository being used for our project. All of the code in this repository was used in the testing, prototyping, and final prototype of our Praxis 3 project. The repository is split into two main folders. These folders are for the two subsystems which require programming during our project. 

# Control Subsystem 
The control subsystem is in charge of controlling all sensors and external devices on the drone and must control flight and image detection processes. This is the most populated folder in our repository and it is split into two sub-folders. Those being **Testing Code** and **Device Libraries**.
